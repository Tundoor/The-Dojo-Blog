# The Dojo blog

This project is a blog website where you can create, edit, and delete posts. It was built using react and was the project built during the react tutorial from Youtuber Net Ninja. The CSS is all my own work, and the functionality is based on the tutorial.

In this project we looked at basic react hooks such as useEffect and useState. We also looked at routing and how to create a mock API using JSON SERVER and also looked at other react concepts. The project is a good example of how to build a simple blog website using react.
